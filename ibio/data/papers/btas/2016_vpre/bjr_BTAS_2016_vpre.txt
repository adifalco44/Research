This report presents results from the Video Person Recognition Evaluation held in conjunction with the 8th IEEE International Conference on Biometrics: Theory, Applications, and Systems (BTAS). Two experiments required algorithms to recognize people in videos from the Pointand-Shoot Face Recognition Challenge Problem (PaSC). The first consisted of videos from a tripod mounted high quality video camera. The second contained videos acquired from 5 different handheld video cameras. There were 1,401 videos in each experiment of 265 subjects. The subjects, the scenes, and the actions carried out by the people are the same in both experiments. An additional experiment required algorithms to recognize people in videos from the Video Database of Moving Faces and People (VDMFP). There were 958 videos in this experiment of 297 subjects. Four groups from around the world participated in the evaluation. The top verification rate for PaSC from this evaluation is 0.98 at a false accept rate of 0.01 â€” a remarkable advancement in performance from the competition held at FG 2015.
