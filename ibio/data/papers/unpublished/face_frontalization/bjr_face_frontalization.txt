Automatic face recognition performance has improved remarkably in the last decade. Much of this success can be attributed to the development of deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). But the training process for CNNs requires a large amount of clean and well-labelled training data. If a CNN is intended to work with non-frontal face images, should this training data be diverse in terms of facial poses, or should face images be frontalized as a pre-processing step? We address this question in this paper. We evaluate a set of popular facial landmarking and pose frontalization algorithms to understand their effect on facial recognition performance. We also introduce a new automatic frontalization scheme that operates over a single image without the need for a subject-specific 3D model, and perform a comparative analysis between the new scheme and other methods in the literature. A CNN trained on face images frontalized using different pre-processing methods is used to extract features from the Point and Shoot Challenge (PaSC) video dataset. The verification and identification performance of the CNN serves to quantify the effectiveness of each landmarking and frontalization scheme. We find that frontalization, although an intuitive pre-processing strategy, does not significantly improve face recognition performance when compared with a simple 2D face alignment.
